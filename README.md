Boundary RabbitMQ Plugin
=======================

Boundary RabbitMQ plugin extracts key performance metrics from an instance of RabbitMQ instances

The RabbitMQ plugin requires that you have python 2.6.6 or later installed on the target system.

## Metrics
Here are the list of metrics created when the RabbitMQ plugin is installed along with their descriptions.

| Metric                                        | Description |

## Configuration

Once the RabbitMQ plugin is install, metric collection requires that a _relay_ is installed on the target system. Instructions on how to install a relay for linux/unix can found[here](http://premium-documentation.boundary.com/relays), and for Windows [here](http://premium-support.boundary.com/customer/portal/articles/1656465-installing-relay-on-windows).


You must use a RabbitMQ user with monitor rights.

General operations for plugins are describe in this [article](http://premium-support.boundary.com/customer/portal/articles/1635550-plugins---how-to)

## Glossary

**binding** - Relates an exchange to a queue by a routing key.

**channel** - A logical connection that shares a single AMPQ connection to RabbitMQ. channels, you have the ability to create as many parallel transport layers as your app needs without being limited by TCP connection restrictions.

**consumer** - Attaches to RabbitMQ server and subscribes to a queue (or named mailbox).

**exchange** - Here come into play the different types of exchanges provided by the protocol. There are four: direct, fanout, topic, and headers. Each implements a different routing algorithm. Messages are sent to exchanges. There are three exchange types: direct, fanout, and topic. Based on the message routing key and the exchange type, the broker will
decide to which queue it has to deliver the message.

**producer** - Create messages and publish (send) them to RabbitMQ

**queue** -

**vhost** - Within every RabbitMQ server there is an ability to create virtual message brokers or _vhosts_. Each one is essentially a mini-RabbitMQ server with its own queues, exchanges, bindings, and access control. Permits the paritioning of a single RabbitMQ server so that it can be used for multiple applications without worrying about applications deleting each others queues,etc.
